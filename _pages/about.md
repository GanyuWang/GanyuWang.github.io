I am Ganyu Wang, PhD in Computer Science, currently a Senior Researcher at Huawei Canada working on AI-powered big data systems and large-scale machine learning platforms. My work lies at the intersection of machine learning, distributed systems, and privacy-preserving computation, with a particular focus on federated learning, LLMs, and data-efficient training methods.

I have over four years of research and engineering experience designing, implementing, and deploying large-scale distributed ML systems in both academic and production environments. My recent industry work focuses on LLM-powered semantic analytics, including the design and optimization of LLM inference pipelines, Spark-based semantic operators, and distributed semantic aggregation systems under strict latency and cost constraints. This includes low-level system optimization involving GPU utilization, batching strategies, prefix-aware inference, and JVM/native performance profiling.

I am interested in research and development roles involving machine learning systems, large language models, and distributed system applications in the United States and Canada.
