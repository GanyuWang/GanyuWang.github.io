Iâ€™m Ganyu Wang, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Western University, specializing in machine learning, distributed systems, and privacy-preserving computation. With a strong academic foundation and practical experience, I have a proven record of developing novel frameworks and algorithms for complex, large-scale distributed learning environments, particularly in Vertical Federated Learning. 


I am open to **research and development positions in machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and distributed system application** in the United States and Canada. Please feel free to contact me through my personal email at [wangganyu0@gmail.com](mailto:wangganyu0@gmail.com) or my university email at [gwang382@uwo.ca](mailto:gwang382@uwo.ca).
