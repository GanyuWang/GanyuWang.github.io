Iâ€™m Ganyu Wang, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Western University, specializing in machine learning, distributed systems, and privacy-preserving computation. With a strong academic foundation and practical experience, I have a proven record of developing novel frameworks and algorithms for complex, large-scale distributed learning environments, particularly in Vertical Federated Learning.
